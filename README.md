[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/intere/mtg-cards.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/intere/mtg-cards)

A Demo app that searches api.magicthegathering.io for [Magic the Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en) cards and shows you those cards.

## Features

## Integration Points
- RVM (recommended) for managing ruby / gem sets
- Cocoapods (1.4.0)
    - Kingfisher (for image loading)
    - UITestKit (for driving UI Tests)
- Fastlane (simple method to run unit tests)
